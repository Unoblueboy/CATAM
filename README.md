# Computer-Aided Teaching of All Mathematics

Within this repository are the CATAM projects from part IB and part II of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, including the question tasks and the corresponding reports. Note that for the IB CATAM Projects, the task PDF had to be taken from a later year, so the general structure of the questions is the same, but the exact numbers used may vary.
